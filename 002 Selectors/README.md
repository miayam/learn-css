How do you apply CSS rule to an element on the web page? By using CSS selector.

There are 5 types of selectors.

* Type Selector matches HTML element directly.
* Class selector matches elements with similar class attribute.
* ID selector matches a supposedly unique element with id attribute.
* Attribute selector matches elements with similar certain attribute other than ID or class.
